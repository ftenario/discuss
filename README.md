# Discuss

Discuss is a web application lesson by Udemy/Stephen Grider based on the Elixir Language and Phoenix web framework.
The lesson at Udemy is based on version Phoenix 1.2. There is a huge change from 1.2 to 1.3 particularly the directory structures and the use of Contexts. This implementation is updated to version 1.3

This implenentaiotn is also using MySQL database server instead of the default PostgreSQL

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
